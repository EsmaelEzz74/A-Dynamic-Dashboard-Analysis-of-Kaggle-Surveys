# A-Dynamic-Dashboard-Analysis-of-Kaggle-Surveys
Uncovering Insights and Trends from the World's Largest Community of Data Scientists 

•In a Kaggle survey of over 90 questions, these represent the responses of over 25,000 data scientists.

•First, we discovered and analyzed the entire data using the pandas library.

•Then we used Plotly Express, to explain the data patterns like percentage of python users, laptop users, and some
frameworks (e.g. Sikit-learn).

•Also, we Arranged the number of countries of the survey participants in a tree chart and interactive charts that the
user can interact with, such as choosing between 2 chart types (e.g. bar chart or pie chart).

•Then, we let the user control every single selection of the 10+ columns that we want to compare and also the
columns that group them.

•Finally, we managed to run a server with the Dash library to introduce the results.
